Consent can be express or implied, and may be given orally, in writing, or electronically. You may withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. Withdrawal of consent may limit our ability to provide certain services to you.

## 5. Limiting Use, Disclosure, and Retention

Personal information collected by R&Co Events will not be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with your consent or as required or permitted by law. We retain personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the identified purposes or as required by law. Once personal information is no longer needed, it will be securely destroyed or anonymized.

We may disclose your personal information to third parties in the following circumstances:

These service providers are contractually obligated to protect your information and use it only for the purposes for which it was disclosed.
*   **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law, court order, or governmental regulation, or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to comply with legal obligations, protect our rights or property, or ensure the safety of our clients or the public.
*   **Business Transfers:** In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your personal information may be transferred as part of the transaction.
